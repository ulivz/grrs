# grrs

A simple `grep` toy written in Rust.

## Motivation

This project is done step by step based on [Command line apps in Rust](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/), 

This is my first time writing a CLI in Rust, Life always requires action and feeling in the process, maybe, when i finish this project, my Rust skills will improve a bit.
